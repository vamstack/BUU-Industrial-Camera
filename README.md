# How this software:
1. Run the file Code_WebCam_Capture.py
2. The webcam will start running.
3. Bring the picture that you want to save in the webcam frame.
4. Once the object is in the right frame, press the key 's' to save a picture.
5. If you want to quit, just press 'q'.
6. After hitting 's' to save the picture,you will get a view of the saved image which will automatically close in 1.6s and a new image file will be created in the same directory as that of the program. The image will be saved as Saved_image.jpg
7. The file saved_image is furthered converted to grayscale and then resized to 30x30 size for further use in relevant programs, for example, machine learning, which was my primary requirement of creating this file.
